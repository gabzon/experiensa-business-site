Destination concerns the city/place/location/ where you are going. We decided to use the word destination for 2 reasons:
<ul>
  <li>It is often used in the tourism industry</li>
  <li>It has a broader meaning than place/city/location <br> Sometimes it is difficult to determine the place because it is not always city/place/location, it could also be a region (Ex: Gran Sabana in Venezuela, Cote d'azur in France, Grand Canyon in USA) </li>
</ul>
