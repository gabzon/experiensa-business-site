Photos are what catches the visitor's eyes, therefore media content (Photos and Videos) are mandatory.<br><br>

Currently we need to add Media content in 4 differnt sections:
<ol>
  <li>Cover image: Resolution of 1920x1080</li>
  <li>Panorama: the width must be at least 2 times bigger than height</li>
  <li>Portrait:The height must be bigger than the width</li>
  <li>Gallery: You can add all images here, don't worry about having different sizes (minimum 4 images, maximum 8)</li>
</ol>

Photos can be taken from this website <a href="http://media.experiensa.com/">http://media.experiensa.com/</a>
<ul>
  <li>Ask Gabriel for missing photos, He is responsible for collecting and optimizing photos for the experiensa system.</li>
  <li>If Gabriel is unable to get the photos in the following 72h, then find the media yourself. <br> (<b>IMPORTANT the images need to be free of copyrights</b>)</li>
  <li>
    Check on free websites like:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://unsplash.com/">https://unsplash.com/</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://pixabay.com/">https://pixabay.com/</a></li>
    </ul>
    <b>The website where you find the image should mention free copyright for commercial use. (Copy the link of the website you downloaded image in the photo description in wordpress and keep it save)</b>
  </li>
  <li>Contact by email the corresponding official tourist office/hotel of the destination, and request the media content with full rights for commercial use, once you have them, send the images to Gabriel to be optimized</li>
  <li>Add one photo the featured image, this will be the cover image, minimum resolution (1920)</li>
